# 📌 College WiFi Attendance System

A simple web-based attendance system that checks whether a student is connected to the **college WiFi (by IP address)** before marking attendance.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Checks if the user is connected to the college network (IP verification).
- ✅ Allows students to enter their **Roll Number** (1–60).
- ✅ Displays a **popup confirmation** with roll number, date, and time.
- ✅ Prevents marking attendance from outside the network.
- ✅ Clean and simple UI.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The script checks your **current IP address** against predefined **college IP ranges**.
2. If you are on the college WiFi, the system allows attendance.
3. A popup shows your details and the time when attendance was marked.
4. In production, the log would be sent to a server/database.
